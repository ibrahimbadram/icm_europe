                                  <p><strong>Dubai, June 2017:</strong> For many people in the UAE, Ramadan isn’t festive at all. This year, ICM decided to brighten up someone's day by providing not only food, but a touch of warmth in the lives of those less fortunate — truly in the spirit of the Ramadan. Smallest things have a huge effect, ensuring everyone has a great festive experience.</p>

                                  <p><strong>China, Jan 2016&nbsp;</strong>:As a member of the FX Charity Foundation, ICM has participated in Xiangxi Aide et Action. Our insistence in philanthropy lives up to our concept of giving back. We believe resourceful youths lead to a resourceful nation; wealthy youths lead to a wealthy nation; strong youths lead to a strong country. When we saw the frail little faces of children who were eager to learn, we felt it was the perfect opportunity for us to help. Although education does not always change a person’s destiny, it can certainly change a person's perception and endow them with the ability to broaden their horizons. To bring positive effects to the world is part of the corporate culture in ICM.</p>
