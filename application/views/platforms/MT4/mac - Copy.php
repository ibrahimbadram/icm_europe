          <p class="uk-text-lead uk-margin-small-bottom">Installing the MetaTrader 4 on your Mac PC can be a straightforward process if you follow this guide. <br>
            <br>
            Our clients have downloaded the Codeweavers Crossover software and have found it to be the most effective way to trade with MT4 on their Mac computer, however there are other ways and it all comes down to personal preference. <br>
            <br>
            CrossOver software enables many Microsoft Windows-based applications to run on your Mac computer or on your Linux operating systems - including the MetaTrader 4 trading platform. <br>
            <br>
            Through the CrossOver software you will be able to use the MetaTrader 4 trading platform to analyze quotes, make trades and develop strategies- same as you would using Windows on a PC or laptop and similar to when you are trading on the move using your iPhone, iPad or Android. <br>
            <br>
            Whether you already have the software, are already a licensed user or you just want to give the free trial a go you can download the MetaTrader 4 onto your Mac by visiting this link: <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/" style="color: #044f80;" target="_blank" >http://www.codeweavers.com/products/</a> <br>
            <br>
            From here you have the option to 'Install Application', 'Download Free Trial' or buy the full CrossOver version by selecting 'Buy Now'.</p>
