<h3><a name="_Toc474446714"></a><a name="_Toc474429607"></a>4- Definitions</h3>



<p><a name="_Toc474446715"></a><strong>4.1- Money Laundering</strong></p>



<p>Money laundering is the process of creating the appearance that large amounts of money obtained from serious crimes, such as drug trafficking or terrorist activity, originated from a legitimate source.</p>



<p>There are three steps involved in the process of laundering money: Placement, Layering and Integration.</p>



<p>4.1.1- Placement</p>



<p>Placement refers to the act of introducing "dirty money" (money obtained through illegitimate, criminal means) into the financial system in some way.</p>



<p>4.1.2- Layering</p>



<p>Layering is the act of concealing the source of that money by way of a series of complex transactions and bookkeeping gymnastics.</p>



<p>4.1.3- Integration</p>



<p>Integration refers to the act of acquiring that money in purportedly legitimate means.</p>



<p><strong><a name="_Toc474446716"></a>4.2- Terrorism Financing</strong></p>



<p>Terrorist financing (proceeds for crime) is the process by which funds are provided for financing or financial support to individual terrorists or terrorist groups.</p>



<p>A terrorist, or terrorist group, is one that has a purpose or activity to facilitate or carry out any terrorist action, and can involve: individuals or groups.</p>



<p><a name="_Toc474446717"></a><strong>4.3- AML/CTF</strong></p>



<p>The term AML CTF refers to “Anti Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing” or “Anti Money Laundering and Combating Terrorism Financing”.</p>



<p><a name="_Toc474446718"></a>4.3.1- Anti-Money Laundering</p>



<p>Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) refers to a set of procedures, laws or regulations designed to stop the practice of generating income through illegal actions.</p>



<p><a name="_Toc474446719"></a>4.3.2- Counter Terrorism Financing</p>



<p>Counter Terrorism Financing (“CTF”) refers to a set of procedures, laws or regulations designed to prevent financing or providing financial support to individual terrorists or terrorist groups.</p>



<p><a name="_Toc474446720"></a><strong>4.4- Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</strong></p>



<p>The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (“FATF”), also known by its French name, Groupe d'action financière (GAFI), is an intergovernmental organization established in July 1989 by a Group of Seven (G-7) Summit in Paris, initially to examine and develop measures to combat money laundering.</p>



<p>In October 2001, the FATF expanded its mandate to incorporate efforts to combat terrorist financing, in addition to money laundering.</p>



<p>The objectives of the FATF are to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.</p>



<p>Starting with its own members, the FATF monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations; reviews money laundering and terrorist financing techniques and counter-measures; and, promotes the adoption and implementation of the FATF Recommendations globally.</p>



<p>The Task Force was given the responsibility of examining money laundering techniques and trends, reviewing the action which had already been taken at a national or international level, and setting out the measures that still needed to be taken to combat money laundering.</p>



<p>In April 1990, less than one year after its creation, the FATF issued a report containing a set of Forty Recommendations, which were intended to provide a comprehensive plan of action needed to fight against money laundering.</p>



<p>In 2001, the development of standards in the fight against terrorist financing was added to the mission of the FATF.</p>



<p>In October 2001, the FATF issued the Eight Special Recommendations to deal with the issue of terrorist financing.  The continued evolution of money laundering techniques led the FATF to revise the FATF standards comprehensively in June 2003.</p>



<p>In October 2004, the FATF published a Ninth Special Recommendations, further strengthening the agreed international standards for combating money laundering and terrorist financing - the 40+9 Recommendations.</p>



<p>In February 2012, the FATF completed a thorough review of its standards and published the revised FATF Recommendations.  This revision is intended to strengthen global safeguards and further protect the integrity of the financial system by providing governments with stronger tools to take action against financial crime. They have been expanded to deal with new threats such as the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and to be clearer on transparency and tougher on corruption.  The 9 Special Recommendations on terrorist financing have been fully integrated with the measures against money laundering. This has resulted in a stronger and clearer set of standards.</p>
