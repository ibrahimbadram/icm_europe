<p><strong>Formula: Credit bonus / 5 = lots to be traded</strong> </p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height:0px;"><strong>Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>10% credit bonus will be issued on each new deposit above 1,000 USD. </li>
<li>The 10% credit bonus will be deposited into the client live account within 2 working days after the actual deposit of the client.</li>
<li>10% credit bonus is for trading purposes only until set amount of lots have been traded; after which credit bonus can be turned into cash.</li>
<li>For each new deposit above 1,000 USD that is made a new bonus can be received as long as the bonus amount does not exceed 1,000 USD bonus per account.</li>
<li>The client may withdraw funds from their account but this may result in credit bonus reduction by 10% of the withdrawal amount.</li>
<li>In the event a client deposits more than 10,000 USD then they will be able to maintain 1,000 USD bonus as long as more than 10,000 USD is maintained in the account. Example: Client deposits 10,000 USD and receives 1,000 USD bonus, they later deposit another 5,000 USD to the same account (they do not receive anything as the maximum bonus they can receive in one account is 1,000 USD). The client then withdraws 5,000 USD; they keep 1,000 USD bonus as this correlates to the original 10,000 USD deposit.</li>
<li>The bonus will be converted to cash once the required number of lots according to following formula “Credit bonus / 5 = lots to be traded”, have been traded.</li>
<li>A maximum of 1,000 USD cash can be issued per account each time the fixed amount of lots has been reached.</li>
<li>Traded lots will be calculated at the end of every week. Any applicable cash reward will be deposited into the clients live account within 2 working days after the end of the week.</li>
<li>Any trades that are closed in less than 7 minutes or closed by the function of “close by” or “close all” will be excluded from the Volume calculation.</li>
<li>If a client trades the number of lots required to convert his credit bonus into cash reward, but the client withdraws funds from their account before the actual deposit of cash reward into their account, this will result in credit bonus/cash reward reduction by 10% of the withdrawal amount.</li>
<li>Client who withdraw funds and redeposit them back into their accounts will not be eligible to 10% credit bonus.</li>
<li>Clients who deposit and withdraw funds frequently might be disqualified from being eligible to receive bonus at the sole discretion of the company.</li>
<li>The company might at its sole discretion disqualify any participant from being eligible to receiving credit bonus if determined that such action is reasonable and/or necessary.</li>
<li>This revised promotion starts on 11<sup>th</sup> June 2017 and is on-going. Clients will be informed before this promotion ends and any remaining trading credit is withdrawn.</li>
