<h3>2. YOUR ACCOUNT AND TRANSACTIONS</h3>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">2.1</strong> You must open an account with us before we will accept any of your Transactions. You must fill out and send to us an Application Form either electronically online, or on the printable form available on our website, or the one available with these Terms and Conditions. All mandatory sections must be filled out and any information supplied must be true and correct to the best of your knowledge. Any incorrect or unclear information supplied will result in either an outright rejection of the application or at the very least a delay in the opening of your client account.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">2.2</strong> In signing, or electronically remitting to us, the application form you are authorising <strong>ICM</strong>  to make such searches as it sees fit to certify that the information that you have supplied is full and correct. Such searches will include, but may not be restricted to, information from the electoral register and any credit agencies approached by <strong>ICM</strong> .</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">2.3</strong> <strong>ICM</strong>  may make periodic checks of your details to verify that the details supplied by you have not changed. However, you must immediately inform <strong>ICM</strong>  in writing as to any material change in your financial circumstances or any change to the information given on your Application Form (including change of employment, address, contact details and email). In <strong>ICM</strong> 's absolute discretion, it may accept such notification over the telephone or by email.

<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">2.5</strong> <strong>ICM</strong>  reserves the right to close or suspend your account at any time by sending you a written notice of 5 working days in advance. Should <strong>ICM</strong>  exercise this right all open Positions shall be closed on <strong>ICM</strong> 's current quoted price and no new trades will be accepted.

<h3>3.  SERVICES BY <strong>ICM</strong> </h3>

</ul>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">3.2</strong> We will deal with you on an execution-only basis at all times.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">3.3</strong> We shall not provide you with any advice on the merits or suitability of you entering into this Agreement or any Transaction contemplated by this Agreement and, will never provide you with any investment advice although we may at our discretion provide you with generic or factual information from time to time on the nature, the terminology and of the procedures involved with such Transactions or concerning factual financial data information. You should rely on your own judgment when deciding whether or not to enter into any Transaction contemplated by this Agreement.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">3.4</strong> When we execute an order on your behalf, we will generally act in accordance with our order Execution Policy. A summary of our current Execution Policy has been provided to you.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">3.5</strong> We provide Contract Specifications in relation to the services that we provide and explaining various matters relating to this Agreement. You should read the Contract Specifications thoroughly before entering into any Transaction. If there is any matter that you do not fully understand then you should seek clarification from us before entering into the Transaction.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">3.6</strong> Any Transaction with <strong>ICM</strong> can only be made during <strong>ICM</strong> Quoting Hours for the market in question and within the permissible Size(s) (unless otherwise agreed by <strong>ICM</strong>). These are further detailed in the Contract Specifications. The minimum and maximum limits are set by us by reference to the normal market size for which prices are available on any relevant exchange or market and which offer live price information. The current minimum and maximum limits are available from us on request and are detailed in the Contract Specifications. We are entitled to vary these minimum and maximum limits and it is your responsibility to ensure that you know what the current limits are before entering into any Transaction. We also have the right to waive any Transaction Size limits with or without notice to you.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">3.7</strong> Our activities with you under this Agreement are likely to include margined transactions. Margined transactions are detailed further at Clauses 7 and 8 below.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">3.8</strong> Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in providing our services, we shall be entitled to take any action as we consider necessary in our absolute discretion to ensure compliance with Applicable Laws. You agree strictly to comply with all Applicable Laws. If we reasonably consider that you have not so complied, we may terminate this Agreement.<br /><strong> Clients are especially reminded that this applies to all forms of market abuse such as insider trading and to directors trading in shares of their own companies.</strong></p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">3.9</strong> <strong>ICM</strong> will not be liable for any losses incurred as a result of any interruption of power supply or electronic communication or information system or any event which prevents <strong>ICM</strong> from supplying such information in one or more of the markets in which we would ordinarily quote.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">3.10</strong> The client accepts that ICM, including its trading platform(s) and other related systems and relevant third parties may perform maintenance/updates or face a technical failure that may including shutting down, restarting or refreshing its systems/servers to ensure more effective operation of its trading platform(s) and/or other related systems. During system maintenance/updates, the client accepts that this may cause the trading platform(s) or other related systems to be inaccessible for a period of time. In addition, the client accepts that there may be mechanical, chart, software, misquotes, computer, telecommunications and/or electronic system failure/issues. In the event of system issues/failure/maintenance/updates, the client accepts that ICM bares no responsibility for any loss, including financial loss, caused due to any of the actions referred to in this paragraph.</p>



<h3>4. PLACING TRADES</h3>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">4.1</strong> <strong>ICM</strong> is not obliged to accept any request to trade.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">4.2</strong> Transactions with <strong>ICM</strong> can only be made via an OTP or a DTP. The OTPs and DTPs have minimum computer software requirements (and further information is available on request). The platforms will be regularly updated and it is strongly suggested that clients should download and install the updates when prompted in order to achieve the most efficient platform functionality.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">4.3</strong> <strong>ICM</strong> quotes a two-way price in a Size acceptable to <strong>ICM</strong> involving a spread between the buy and the sell price. As the Client you may buy at the higher price or sell at the lower price.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">4.4</strong> When placing a Transaction, you must give your name and account number or username. Without this information no Transaction will be permitted even if it is to close an existing open Position. When transacting over the telephone the Transaction will only be accepted by <strong>ICM</strong> when we confirm that your Transaction has been accepted. The verbal acceptance of a trade by <strong>ICM</strong> does not negate either <strong>ICM</strong>'s or your rights in the event of a Pricing Error.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">4.5</strong> All calls to <strong>ICM</strong> telephone lines are recorded, and you hereby agree to the recording of such conversations. All OTPs and DTPs retain chronological histories of all Transactions conducted over that medium (including Transactions entered by <strong>ICM</strong> following an instruction by telephone) and an electronic audit trail of all client activity (although this is not guaranteed). All such records and recordings of telephone conversations are the exclusive property of <strong>ICM</strong> and may be used as evidence in any dispute.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">4.6</strong> Before access is permitted to an OTP or a DTP you will be obliged to enter your username or account number and password. When placing a Transaction via an OTP your confirmation will be via an email contract note. Transactions on a DTP will be confirmed via an on screen contract note. The contract is binding on both parties except for instances of a Pricing Error. <strong>ICM</strong> will treat Transactions placed via an OTP or a DTP as active on receipt of such an instruction and of its acceptance. Transactions placed via an OTP or a DTP will normally be confirmed at the time they are made by electronic means.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">4.7</strong> Your username, password and account number are extremely sensitive pieces of information. Any Transactions made on your account either over the telephone, an OTP or a DTP using either your username, account number or your password will be deemed as valid Transactions. You must not disclose your username, account number or password to any person (save disclosure of your account number to an Authorised Third Party pursuant to Clause 15). You must immediately inform <strong>ICM</strong> if you are aware or suspect that a third party has had access to your username, account number or password or that any person other than you (or your Authorised Third Party) is transacting on your account.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">4.8</strong> In the case of Transactions placed via an OTP or a DTP, <strong>ICM</strong> is under no obligation to recognise the domain from which a client is trading, and it is your sole responsibility to ascertain the legality of placing trades from your local jurisdiction.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">4.9</strong> A Transaction can only be placed on a current valid Quote. A price may change at any time after it has been quoted and before you have traded. A Quote made to you over the telephone is only valid for that conversation and may not be available on any subsequent telephone call. Quotes that have been given as 'indication only' are not valid and cannot be traded unless otherwise agreed by <strong>ICM</strong>. Quotes that have been qualified or Quotes that you have been told are no longer valid before you place your Transaction are also not tradable.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">4.10</strong> In the case of Transactions placed via an OTP or a DTP you may only offer to place a trade on the prices currently quoted on an OTP or a DTP. Such prices are indicative and on receipt <strong>ICM</strong> may, in its absolute discretion, reject or accept your proposed Transaction. Due to the nature of online trading systems and the potential unreliability, delays, misquotes of market price feeds, <strong>ICM</strong> may in its absolute discretion remove or delete Transactions and any associated Transactions (i.e. any trades closing subsequently deleted trades) which have been made over an OTP or a DTP which in the opinion of <strong>ICM</strong> do not reflect the actual market prices at the time of the placement of the relevant Transaction. <strong>ICM</strong> will not be responsible for losses or potential losses sustained by you in trading on a rejected or cancelled Transaction. <strong>ICM</strong> is not responsible or liable for losses made with other companies on Transaction undertaken in reference to a rejected or cancelled trade.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">4.11</strong> The spot foreign exchange and commodities markets can experience extreme price volatility often referred to as "Hectic or Fast Market", it is particularly common during material economic or political events, such as news releases and monetary policy change. During such times it is common practice for the Capital Markets to execute orders manually and widen spread and place less reliance on automated systems. This practice can affect online price providers and may slow down their service to customers, increase re-quotes, human errors due to the extra time required to analyse the event and determine the fair market price. This may cause significant delays in trade execution and order processing while rates are cross-referenced to ensure valid execution. ICM relies more on automated system and execute trades automatically by our server to reduce delays, re-quotes and human errors and we maintain our fixed spread (except during very hectic market or holidays), therefore, protecting our clients stop-losses. Based on this, and to keep you informed of our policy in this regard, please be informed that ICM reserves the right to cancel any trade that has been confirmed by our automated system during major news, figure releases or fast market that does not reflect the actual market price or the price has been delayed due to inevitable latency issue, thus preventing traders abusing our automated system or fixed spread.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">4.12</strong> ICM does not allow scalping where the trading style is abusing our Automated Services for short term gain by sniping and hunting for on old price or wrong quotes or trading during illiquid market or trading during fundamental releases/news releases where the price on ICM Market watch could be delayed due inevitable latency issue or trade using expert advisors or other robots for abusive purposes. Customers are urged to trade ethically and not to try to take advantage of our competitive services. Customers will solely be held liable and will indemnify ICM from any damages or losses that may result from cancelling such trades. Clients are not permitted to Scalp or snipe.</p>



<h3>5. TRADING</h3>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">5.1</strong> Clients should note that they are trading on the outcome of the price of a financial derivative, and will not be entitled to delivery of, or be required to deliver, the underlying product.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">5.2</strong> This trading does not occur on an exchange. Rather the trading occurs off- exchange or over-the-counter ("OTC"). As a result, <strong>ICM</strong> enter directly into a contract with you in respect of the financial instrument you wish to trade.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">5.3</strong> ICM reserves the right to discontinue an Islamic/SWAP-free account by sending 24 hours notice. ICM will invoke this right in case of suspicion of abuse, in which case ICM may, at its sole discretion, decide to close all open positions in the account and deduct or add swaps for all transactions currently and/or previously made in the account and decline from accepting any further requests from the Client to be exempted from SWAP.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">5.4</strong> The above provisions shall apply with respect to any constituent security of a securities basket or securities index and are also subject to any such adjustment being scaled back in proportion to the respective weighting of the affected security within the securities basket or securities index as we reasonably consider appropriate.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">5.5</strong> If a share becomes subject to a takeover offer, suspended, merger and stock split <strong>ICM</strong> reserves the right to close any or all trades at the closing of the day or the last closing trading price before the amendment.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">5.6</strong> In certain market conditions it may not be possible to close a single share Transaction with sizable market consideration in full at one price. Such a Transaction may instead be closed at a price reflecting the price at which <strong>ICM</strong> is able to transact any relevant underlying hedge but only during the trading hours of the Underlying Market (whether or not the relevant Transaction was opened during or outside the Underlying Market trading hours).</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">5.7</strong> If the Underlying Market in relation to an existing open Position held by you becomes illiquid in any fashion, either leaving <strong>ICM</strong> unable to purchase sufficient amount of the underlying shares or contracts to cover your Transaction or Position or is unable to borrow the same in the open market, <strong>ICM</strong> reserves the right to close all or part of any such Transaction or Position at the current <strong>ICM</strong> Quote.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">5.8</strong> If a share or an Underlying Market is subject to dividends or fundamental news announcement, and the client with an existing open position in the same shares. ICM may close partial or all position in shares to bring the equity/margin level above 200%.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">5.9</strong> If you are trading in concert whereby multiple clients are placing identical trades then <strong>ICM</strong> may at its sole discretion treat this as one Trade. Therefore, if the combined size is greater than the liquidity of the market and slippage occurs, all clients may be treated the same regardless of their individual stake size and filled at the same level which will be where <strong>ICM</strong> was able to realistically able to trade in the Underlying Market.</p>



<h3>6. OPEN POSITIONS</h3>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">6.1</strong> Positions may be closed at any time within <strong>ICM</strong>'s Quoting Hours (except where the relevant market is suspended or not available for whatever reason) unless <strong>ICM</strong> notifies you otherwise. <strong>ICM</strong> may accept closure of Positions at other times dependent upon the market but is not obliged to do so.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">6.2</strong> You are not required to close a Position prior to the Expiry Date provided that your account is not in deficit. However, in certain circumstances and in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, <strong>ICM</strong> shall be entitled or may be required to close your Position prior to their Expiry Date notwithstanding that your account is not in deficit.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">6.3</strong> If the Expiry Date of a Transaction is not a recognised business day of the relevant Underlying Market, then the business day immediately preceding that stated will be considered as the Expiry Date unless an alternative is specifically stated in the Contract Specifications or <strong>ICM</strong> notifies you otherwise.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">6.4</strong> Open Positions will automatically close on their Expiry Date and at their expiry time (as are detailed in the Contract Specifications) at the ICM closing price on that day. We ask our customers with existing futures open interest to take notice of our market information sheet and act accordingly.</p>



<h3>7.  NEW ORDERS, STOP LOSS ORDERS AND LIMIT ORDERS</h3>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">7.1</strong>  There are generally two basic order types available:</p>



<ul>



<li>New Orders; and</li>



<li>Stop or Limit Orders.</li>



</ul>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">7.2</strong> New Orders are orders that are not connected to an existing open Position (although they may close existing Positions (unless where <strong>ICM</strong> expressly agree otherwise (see 6.2 above)) if, when executed, they create trades that are opposite to existing open Positions). <strong>ICM</strong> will accept the following types of new orders:</p>



<ul>



<li>Good Till Cancelled" means that the order will remain in effect until cancelled by you or until the market expires and <strong>ICM</strong> ceases to quote the relevant market;</li>



<li>Good For Day" means that the order will remain in effect until the end of the <strong>ICM</strong> Quoting Hours for the relevant market for that day;</li>



<li>Good Until" means that the order will remain in effect until the time and date requested by you when placing the order or until <strong>ICM</strong> ceases to quote the relevant market (whichever is the sooner).</li>



</ul>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">7.3</strong> All Good Till Cancelled/Good for Day/Good Until orders are based on an Our Quote basis.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">7.4</strong> A Good Till Cancelled order will only be valid during <strong>ICM</strong>'s Quoting Hours for the market concerned. If there is any form of gap between the close of the market as quoted by <strong>ICM</strong> on one trading session and its subsequent reopening either on the next session or, in the case of a Force Majeure, whenever <strong>ICM</strong> reopens said market, the Client's Stop will be executed at the <strong>ICM</strong> Quote based upon the first price that <strong>ICM</strong> is reasonably able to obtain in the Underlying Market.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">7.5</strong> Any orders placed as Stop Losses on open Positions shall:</p>



<ul>



<li>Be deemed Good Until Cancelled or until the contract expires or until such time as you close the relevant Position;</li>



<li>Be deemed to be in respect of <strong>ICM</strong> Quote/Our Quote; and</li>



<li>Be valid in respect, solely, of the market in respect of which <strong>ICM</strong> accepted the order and not for any other.</li>



</ul>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">7.6</strong> In respect of markets quoted by <strong>ICM</strong> outside the trading hours of the relevant Underlying Market, all orders are based on <strong>ICM</strong>'s Quote/Our Quote and may be filled at the <strong>ICM</strong> Quote based on a price which is in <strong>ICM</strong>'s opinion fair and reasonable in light of prevailing world markets at that time.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">7.7</strong> <strong>ICM</strong> will accept orders placed in any market during the hours in which <strong>ICM</strong> offers a Quote in said market. However no Stops or of orders any kind in any market will be executed outside of the <strong>ICM</strong> quoting hours for that market except by agreement with <strong>ICM</strong>. Upon the opening of any market quoted by <strong>ICM</strong> any currently actionable Stop, Limit or New Order will be filled at the first Quote for the relevant market that <strong>ICM</strong> is reasonably able to obtain with reference to the Underlying Market and the size of the order in question.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">7.8</strong> It is your responsibility to cancel any order that you no longer require. Any uncancelled order placed by you may be filled by <strong>ICM</strong> and may therefore cause losses to which you will be liable. In the case of Stop Loss orders if the related Transaction is closed by you the Stop Loss order will be deemed automatically cancelled. If the underlying Stop Loss on any open Position was actionable before you closed the open Position, <strong>ICM</strong> may at its sole discretion adjust the closing price of your trade to reflect the Stop Loss price.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">7.9</strong> An order will be executed when the <strong>ICM</strong> Quote reaches the price specified in your order or trades through the price specified. All Quotes are based upon an Underlying Market that is sourced from either a recognised global exchange (LSE, NYSE, LIFFE etc) or from a wholesale counterparty (a quoting bank or market maker). Our Quote may be higher or lower than the Underlying Market due to interest rate costs, dividends, scrip issues, stock splits, competitors' quotes or the weight of client business. The understanding of the definition of Our Quote is very important for the correct operation of your account. If you do not understand any part of its description we strongly recommend that you contact <strong>ICM</strong> for an explanation.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">7.10</strong> <strong>ICM</strong> is not obliged to inform you if an order is filled. It is solely your responsibility to ensure that you know at all times as to whether any order has been filled or is still active and if you are in any doubt whatsoever as to deal acceptance it is your sole responsibility to contact <strong>ICM</strong> immediately, in the first instance by telephone, in order to obtain clarification as to the validity of any Transaction.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">7.11</strong> Once a Stop, Limit or New Order level is reached <strong>ICM</strong> may at its sole discretion allow a client to amend this order before it has been actioned by <strong>ICM</strong>. Although, receipt of any confirmation of an order amendment is not binding on <strong>ICM</strong>, <strong>ICM</strong> may at its sole discretion decide to execute the original order if the activation of that order occurred before the amendment was made. <strong>ICM</strong> shall not be liable for any Positions generated by clients' assumption of non-activation of a fairly executed order.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">7.12</strong> Unless otherwise stipulated, no orders are guaranteed and are subject to Gapping (which is detailed below at 7.14).</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">7.13</strong> If a New Order is subject to Gapping (see 7.14) on activation and the order is actioned at a price that would also have activated any associated Limit or Stop orders, then the Position will immediately be closed with a loss to the client of the prevailing <strong>ICM</strong> quoted spread for that market.<br>



<strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">7.14</strong> In this Agreement "Gapping" refers to an occurrence whereby the market moves from one quoted price and that this second quote is significantly different to the first. Where such an event happens and where the second quote is through an order level (Stop Loss, Limit or New Order), when the first quote was not, this may trigger a Gapping event.<br />There are a variety of reasons why this might happen. Some of the more usual are listed below, but this list is by no means exhaustive.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">7.14.1</strong> because the particular Underlying Market on which the order is placed has opened and started trading at a price significantly different from the previous session closing price;</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">7.14.2</strong> Accordingly you must understand the potential impact of these events on any Order that you have on your account.<br />All orders (Stop, Limit or New Order) are subject to slippage on the market open. In a situation where slippage occurs during trading hours, any buy order (new or limit) below the market or sell order (new or limit) above the market and sell orders (closing or stop) below the market or buy orders (closing or stop) above the market may be subject to slippage. If any market gaps from one quoted price to another due to any market sensitive piece of information (such as a profit warning or an economic data release), then any order in place between these prices will be activated.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">7.15</strong>  Where a series of orders may be filled to close existing open Positions and/or open new Positions then these orders will be filled by <strong>ICM</strong> in any sequence determined by <strong>ICM</strong>. If this results in subsequent orders having insufficient Trading Resources for activation, then these orders will be cancelled. <strong>ICM</strong> will not look at an order filling sequences that may result in one order being filled and another failing, <strong>ICM</strong> will fill orders as and when they are seen by <strong>ICM</strong>, and at our sole discretion.</p>



<h3>8.  MARGIN CALCULATIONS</h3>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">8.1</strong> In general <strong>ICM</strong> only allows its clients to trade on Deposit Accounts (where money must be deposited before trading can commence).</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">8.2</strong> You agree to provide to us and to maintain on your account at all times such Margin as is necessary to cover the Margin Requirement. Your agreement is repeated for every Transaction entered into by you and shall relate separately to each account, if you have more than one account with us.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">8.3</strong> The minimum level of cleared funds that you are required to maintain on your account at any particular time as margin against any open positions is referred to as the Margin Requirement. <strong>ICM</strong> may at its sole discretion alter the Margin Requirements on your account.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">8.4</strong> <strong>ICM</strong> will normally monitor the amount of Margin available for any Transaction but reserves the right to demand further Margin than may have been originally requested. In circumstances during high market volatility or depending on the weight of customer business or the trading style or before an important fundamental releases or due to general increase of margin for an instrument in the exchange or at the closing of the week, ICM reserves the right to increase the margin requirement by reducing the leverage offered and/or to increase the stop out level (equity/margin) from the agreed level up to 100% by giving a written notice. In such case if the stop out level is below 100% then ICM will hedge the positions or partially close them to bring the equity/margin at to above 100%. Customers will solely be held liable from any damages or losses that may result from closing the position/positions.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">8.5</strong> <strong>ICM</strong> maintains the right to close any client position/positions when stop out level (equity/margin) falls at 0% of the total margin requirement or the level agreed with the client. In case the balance or equity becomes negative as a result of stop out, ICM reserves the right to claim the balance from the client to adjust the equity back to zero. As stated in clause 8.4, ICM reserves the right to increase the stop out level by giving a written notice to the client.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">8.6</strong> An order placed as a Stop Loss for a position may not necessarily reduce the Margin Requirement.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">8.7</strong> Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, <strong>ICM</strong> is entitled, in its absolute discretion, to permit any trade for a Size which is above the recognised maximum single Size for a particular market.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">8.8</strong> The minimum IMR for any market and stop out level may be changed from time to time by <strong>ICM</strong> without notice to you (for example, during volatile market conditions or due to the illiquid nature of any Underlying Market). These new margin requirements and stop out level will be applied to all your existing Positions as well as any new Transactions. Most contracts’ Minimum IMR is set out in the Contract Specifications which are correct at the time of publication. Margin Requirements which are not set out in the Contract Specifications or which have changed since the date of publication of the Contract Specifications will be quoted on request or posted on the website. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are using the most recent margin requirements applicable.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">8.9</strong> Occasionally new or temporary markets are created. These markets attract their own margin requirement that may not be published but will be available on demand.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">8.10</strong> You undertake to provide us with and to maintain on your account at all times sufficient cleared funds in order to meet the margin requirement, and such undertaking shall be deemed to be repeated each time you open enter into a Transaction. A failure to meet your margin obligations at any time is a Default Event and may result in us closing out your open Positions without notice to you.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">8.11</strong> Neither the funds on your account nor the margin applied to your Position(s) represent your total financial liability to <strong>ICM</strong>.</p>



<h3>9.  MARGIN CALLS</h3>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">9.1</strong> It is your responsibility to monitor your open Positions and all other relevant factors used to calculate Margin payable. <strong>ICM</strong> is not obliged to make Margin Calls of you at all or within any specific time period. We shall not be liable to you for any failure by us to contact you or attempt to contact you.</p>



<h3>10.  FEES AND PAYMENTS</h3>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">10.1</strong> In addition to Margin payments (as required and detailed above at Clauses 7 and 8 above) you agree to pay to us such sums of money as may from time to time be due to us as a result of a Transaction or Position (including any charges and/or commissions detailed from time to time in the Contract Specifications) and such sums as may be required in or towards clearance of any debit balance on any account.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">10.2</strong> You will pay all applicable Value Added Tax (VAT) and other taxes and all other fees reasonably incurred by us in connection with any Transaction. Any changes to tax laws which result in future imposition of stamp duty, capital gains tax or other tax, which may from time to time be levied on Transactions shall be for your account. You may be liable for other charges and taxes that are not imposed by us. You are solely responsible for the timely payment of such charges and taxes. You should seek independent advice if you are in any doubt as to what further charges or taxes may apply to you as a result of you entering this Agreement.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">10.3</strong> In the event that charges are imposed by the credit or debit Card Company (or any other provider) used to deposit funds on to your account, these may be charged by us to you. <strong>ICM</strong> will not be responsible for any non¬payment of these charges and will not be liable for any proceedings or further charges resulting from non-payment of such charges.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">10.4</strong> You agree that we may share commission and charges with our Associated Companies, Trading Partners or other third parties or receive or pay remuneration from or to the same in respect of Transactions entered into by us with you. Details of any such remuneration or sharing arrangements (for example where you have been introduced to us through a third party) will not be set out in the relevant contract note. Please note that such commissions and charges will only be paid where we are satisfied that such payments do not impair our obligation to act in the best interests of our client.</p>



<h3>11. TRANSACTION SPECIFICATIONS</h3>

<h3>12. EXPIRY OF FUTURE CONTRACTS</h3>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">12.1</strong> At ICM we do not roll-over dated OTC Future contracts. All positions that remain open at expiration will be closed at the ICM closing price on that day. Next month contracts will be available for trading at least four days before front month expiration, therefore, it is the sole responsibility of the client to take notice of expiries and act accordingly.</p>

Such settlement shall be made at the prevailing <strong>ICM</strong> Quote (Our Quote) for each trade at the time of settlement or at the first such time that such a settlement may be practicably made. The settlement amount in respect of each open Position shall be calculated by <strong>ICM</strong> at its sole discretion as the difference between the opening value of each trade and its value on the settlement price.</p>

<h3>15. AUTHORISED THIRD PARTY</h3>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">15.1</strong> <strong>ICM</strong> recognises that in some circumstances it may be necessary or desirable for you to authorise someone to manage your account.

<h3>18. FORCE MAJEURE</h3>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">18.1</strong> Force Majeure events are exceptional, unusual, or emergency market conditions which may prevent <strong>ICM</strong> from performing any or all of its obligations hereunder. They include, without limitation:</p>



<ul>



<li>markets that, in <strong>ICM</strong>'s reasonable assessment, are in an emergency or exceptional state;</li>



<li>the suspension or closure of any market upon which we base our quotes, or the imposition of limits or special or unusual terms on the trading in any such market;</li>



<li>the occurrence of any speculative movements which in our reasonable assessment distort the level of prices in any market quoted by us;</li>

<li>an event which prevents <strong>ICM</strong> from making orderly markets in any contract normally quoted by <strong>ICM</strong> for the purposes of making Transactions;</li>

<li>any act, event or occurrence including any strike, riot or civil commotion, terrorism, interruption of power supply or electronic communication or information system technical or communication problems or other act of god caused through loss of power which prevents <strong>ICM</strong> from providing a normal</li>

<ul>



<li>displayed on screen in relation to a DTP Transaction; or</li>

</ul>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">19.2</strong> Any material action affecting your account will trigger an email and/or an on¬screen confirmation. The absence of an email confirmation or on-screen confirmation of an action on your account will not affect the validity of any Transaction or order which has been placed.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">19.3</strong> It is solely your responsibility to keep yourself fully up to date in respect of all your Transactions and Positions. As soon as you receive any contract note you must check it to make certain that it is correct. The sooner that <strong>ICM</strong> is made aware of any error or problem, the sooner we will be able to look into or correct it. You must also regularly check your online statement.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">19.4</strong> Your account statement will be available online at any time unless <strong>ICM</strong> has suspended your account or an OTP or a DTP is unavailable for any reason.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">19.5</strong> If you receive a contract note for a Transaction or filled order that you allege has not been transacted by or for you, <strong>ICM</strong> must be notified immediately. If you do not receive a contract note for a Transaction you have placed (or believe you have placed) you must notify <strong>ICM</strong> immediately.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">19.6</strong> If you think that any contract note or statement contains any error you must notify <strong>ICM</strong> immediately.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">19.7</strong> Any query or dispute in respect of any trade or conversation, together with details of the time and date of the trade or conversation must be communicated to <strong>ICM</strong> as soon as you become aware of it. If the dispute or complaint is not satisfactorily resolved it should be referred, again with all details, to the Client Services team of <strong>ICM</strong>.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">19.8</strong> In the event of any query or dispute <strong>ICM</strong> may at its discretion immediately close, at the prevailing <strong>ICM</strong> quote or the first such quote available, any Position that is in dispute. No matter what the subsequent result of the dispute, <strong>ICM</strong> will not reopen or reinstate any such closed trade.</p>



<p><strong style="font-size: 16px; color:#000000;">19.9</strong> Client money will be deposited into a client money bank account. In the event that <strong>ICM</strong> was to become insolvent all client money held in the third party bank account would be protected. In the event that the third party bank was to become insolvent you may be entitled to compensation from the Scheme if the third party bank were unable to meet their obligations. This depends on the type of business you undertake, your status, and the circumstances of the claim.</p>
